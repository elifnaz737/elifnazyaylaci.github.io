<p>Ankara, is the capital of the Republic of Turkey. <br>
It is Turkey's second largest city after former imperial capital Istanbul, having overtaken İzmir.<br>
Ankara was Atatürk's headquarters from 1920 and has been the capital of the Republic since the latter's founding in 1923 <br>
The government is a prominent employer, but Ankara is also an important commercial and industrial city, <br>
located at the center of Turkey's road and railway networks.<br>
The city gave its name to the Angora wool shorn from Angora rabbits, the long-haired Angora goat (the source of mohair),<br>
and the Angora cat. The area is also known for its pears, honey and muscat grapes. <br>

Ankara can be considered a green city in terms of green areas per inhabitant, at 72 square metres (775 square feet) per head.<br>
Ankara is a very old city with various Hittite, Phrygian, Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman archaeological sites. <br>
The historical center of town is a rocky hill rising 150 m (500 ft) over the left bank of the Ankara Çayı, a tributary of the Sakarya River,<br>
the classical Sangarius. The hill remains crowned by the ruins of the old citadel. Although few of its outworks have survived,<br>
there are well-preserved examples of Roman and Ottoman architecture throughout the city, the most remarkable being the 20 bc Temple of Augustus and Rome <br>
that boasts the Monumentum Ancyranum, the inscription recording the Res Gestae Divi Augusti <br></p>
